Extending to other Walgreens.com categories:

The script already works on other Walgreens.com categories because the store front is standardized
across their different pages except for `Top Deals`

To scrape all, after the initial setup each category could be scraped by creating new 
`Walgreens_CategoryScraper` objects and passing them their assigned category.


Extending to other domains:

To extend to other domains would take some generalizing. The same or an extended data object would
work but the X_DataCleaner was intended handle the quirks of how a specific shopfront presented
their raw data. Instead a generic formatter could be made that enforces a template instead and would
be more portable across domains.

The scrapeProductPage function should work with updated selectors or could be setup as a generic that
accepts a set of selectors for desired data elements.

The scrape function also would be straightforward to adapt since it mostly handles wrangling
the browser after the domain specific navigation is done. The selector would need to be pointed at 
the new product card container and the `a:first-of-type` could be `a:nth-of-type` thats passed in.

Lastly the navigate function would need to be rewritten from scratch or substituted with a direct
link to the store page of interest.

These pieces could also be separated out and the scraper built as a composed object built with 
whichever generic functions would be applicable. This way new page scrapers could be 
attempted with off the shelf components before commiting to a wholly new build.
